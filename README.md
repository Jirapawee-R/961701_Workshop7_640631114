# 961701_Workshop7_640631114
961701_Workshop7_640631114 is an assignment to compare
self-implement KNN classifier with sklearn knn classifier.
Dataset used in this project is Iris datasets available on 
sklearn datasets.

### Class: KNeighboursSelfImplement
class of self-implement KNN classifier composed of 5 functions
including:
1) fit() -> call KNeighboursSelfImplement.fit(X_train, y_train)
2) calculateDistance() -> call  KNeighboursSelfImplement.calculateDistance(x1, x2)
3) getKNeighbors() -> call  KNeighboursSelfImplement.getKNeighbors(X_test)
4) predict() -> call  KNeighboursSelfImplement.predict(X_test)
5) score()-> call  KNeighboursSelfImplement.score(X_test, y_test)
